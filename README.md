# causal-inference-final-project

This project investigates the causal effects of student employment on their academic performance, aiming to discern how working alongside academic studies influences studentâ€™s academic performance. By focusing on isolating the causal impact of employment from other potentially confounding variables, this project seeks to answer whether employment during college positively or negatively affects student grades, and to what measurable extent (ATE).
If we had the resources to investigate this question through conducting a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), we would randomly assign a group of students into two groups: a treatment group, which would work while studying, and a control group, which would not work. Over a semester, both groups would follow this arrangement, then take exams at the end. We would then collect and compare their grades to assess the treatment effect. However, since such resources are unavailable, we will rely on observational dataset instead.
The first step in the process will be identification. In this phase, we will outline the assumptions that underpin our analysis, create a causal graph to model the problem and the causal relationships between variables, and establish a timeline. The next phase will be estimation, during this phase we will estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using several methods, including Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW), matching, and learning models.
